# PersonDetection
This is a custom-trained object detection model using YOLOv5 to identify human presence through Thermal Imaging.  It enables accurate person detection in low-light or no-light environments by leveraging Infrared thermal data instead of regular RGB input.  This system is ideal for Surveillance, Search and rescue operations and Security use cases
